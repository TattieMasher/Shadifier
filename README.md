# Shady Link Generator
This project is a fun take on the traditional URL shortener, designed to create purposefully shady-looking links for humorous purposes. Unlike typical URL shorteners, this adds a twist by generating URLs that purposefully appear suspicious, reminiscent of internet scams or clickbait. Hopefully you too enjoy the use of everyone's favourite font; COMIC SANS.

## Features
- **URL Transformation:** Converts standard URLs into "shady" versions, incorporating elements that mimic the style of clickbait or scam links.
- **Custom Expiry:** Users can set an expiry date for the shady URLs, after which the links will no longer redirect (defaults to 30 days).
- **Database Integration:** Stores transformed URLs in a MySQL database, mapped against the originals along with their expiry dates.
- **Responsive Design:** The interface is responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across various devices.

## Usage
1. **Enter a URL:** Users input the URL they wish to transform.
2. **Set Expiry Date:** Users can choose how long the link will remain active.
3. **Generate Shady Link:** Shadifier then generates a new, "shady" version of the URL.
4. **Share & Enjoy:** The new URL can be shared with friends for a humorous effect.

## Technologies Used
### Backend
- PHP for server-side logic.
- MySQL for database management.
### Frontend
- HTML & CSS for a playful, engaging and ridiculously scammy design.

## Disclaimer (please read)
Shadifier is created for entertainment purposes only. The generated URLs are not 100% not intended for malicious use. This was created entirely just for fun.

Enjoy creating and sharing your shady links (responsibly, please)!
